Hi. Welcome. Not sure how you got here, but this is my blog. After countless crashes, I am resurrecting it yet again. Unfortunately the last crash burned everything I wrote in the past few years, so you know. Blank slate. I am planning to move to more professional topics anyways so my previous posts (which were additionally in Hungarian) wouldn't fit in here.
So what I'm hoping is that I'll be able to share my pet projects as well as my insights about agile and people management here. If you're interested, stay tuned.
