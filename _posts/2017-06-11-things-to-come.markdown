## New start

So here we are. I am sitting here and finally updating this whole thing, hoping that jekyll will high-five github pages when I push the commit and a beautiful post will appear on the blog.

### But why?

I don't have anyone to write to and I don't have people reading me. Which is fine. The motivation behind starting to write again is many-fold nontheless. The first trigger was that I also had to start writing for my current employer (Sensent) in *English*. Man, was that some clunky shit to start with. I used to like writing. I think I might have been good at it (in my mother tongue at least, which is Hungarian - linguistically in a different solar system compared to English).
And now I struggle to write words after words. Trying to sound professional. Trying to find my *voice*. After several posts and papers I realized that my writing muscles have gone weak.

I need to exercise. This is happening right now.

## Organizing stuff

The second part of the equation is about tackling the amount of information, that I need to deal with in a daily basis.
I, too, read blogs, books, listen to countless podcasts each day, go to conferences and even - I know, this is hard to believe - come up with my own ideas.
Getting the most out of this heap of information is hard.
I remember reading not long ago the fine book by Ben Horowitz,
*"The Hard Things About Hard Things"*. I remember devouring it in a weekend and meanwhile thinking
> "I'm gonna try the shit out of these things. This is great. Just wait till I get to the end."


Now I don't remember half of it. Now, I'm sure *everyone* has some kind of mechanism of creating notes of every single important thing they learn, but I don't.
Or coming to think of it, *now* I have. Yay, me!

## Having fun

As I mentioned earlier, I *like* writing. I always have, I suppose. So why miss the fun, when you can have it? 
The only thing I need to learn now is to be good at it in a different language I use all day.
Piece of cake, eh?

## Accountability

So during a week I work and read and learn and go on cool dates with my SO, so every minutes seems spent from the get go.
Nevertheless, I have around a zillion project ideas. Perfect shiny project ideas I can start writing *code* for.
Put them here on github and then proudly salivate over them. So if I'm able to create the right structure for *everything* I imagined doing (harsh prediction: *which I won't be*), you'll see some posts describing my personal projects. Such fun.

## Gifs

Even though our marketing guy is *not my real mom*, he does not let me use gifs in corporate blog posts.
It makes me sad, because it was *really* hard for me to start writing professional texts in a foreign language
and these images helped me build cohesion and give a unique character to the whole post at the same time.

Anyways. Here, I can do whatever I want.

**Again: yay, me.** ;)
